#bart-upstream

Sarah Lessner

expanding on "bart-impatient" group project.
I personally worked on the BART functionality and wish to expand on the features.
Goals: adding "via point" for upstreaming (knowledgable BART users can decide based on experience how far to upstream)
       automatically suggest upstream routes based on ability to make connection with x number of destination trains

Changes from original project:
Omitting YouTube features from original project
Designing my own more simplistic front-end
